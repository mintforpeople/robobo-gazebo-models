# robobo-gazebo-models
Different objects that can be included in the Robobo Gazebo worlds (https://github.com/mintforpeople/robobo-gazebo-simulator)

These objects that can be included in these worlds have been modeled, so the robot can interact with them.

All the models are saved in .sdf format, so that later the user can insert them into any gazebo world. To do this, the content of this repository must be copied into the user's models folder (/home/<username>/model_editor_models).
